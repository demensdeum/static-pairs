# Static Pairs - Name + Type

## Overview

Static Pairs - Name + Type is a tool designed to create a value name-to-type notation by processing files with source code transpiling based on rules specified in a configuration file. The transpiling process generates consistent and reusable result code, aligning with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by minimizing redundancy. 
Example prototype version is implemented in Python, offering a straightforward and easy-to-understand approach for file processing tasks. The prototype source code example implementation is in Objective-C++, while the preprocessor is in Python. This tool is intended for source code only.

## Features

- **Configuration-Driven**: Reads a configuration file to determine text replacement rules.
- **Flexible Processing**: Processes input files line-by-line, applying replacements as specified.
- **Ease of Use**: The Python script provides a simple interface for defining and applying text replacement rules.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Running the Script

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/static-pairs-preprocessor.git
   cd static-pairs-preprocessor
   ```

2. Execute the Python script with the necessary input files:
   ```bash
   python StaticPairsPreprocessor.py
   ```

## Usage

Ensure that the input file and configuration file are correctly specified within the script or passed as arguments.
